# Farm Africa

### Nairobi, Kenya

### What we were doing to help
This project established urban gardens in collaboration with community groups and schools. 
School gardens are maintained by parents, teachers, and class councils and are equipped with 
rainwater harvesting systems, greenhouses, surficial wells, and drip irrigation systems.
Community groups received livestock, training in organic farming methods, 
and opportunities to access new markets and micro-enterprises, strengthening both income and food security. 
Additionally, we partnered with local government authorities to plan urban agriculture on available land 
and implement and assess food security interventions.

### Who did we work with?
Farm Africa was working in a consortium with Amref Health Africa and Kenyan government partners 
to reduce malnutrition, increase incomes, and promote sustainable farming and soil conservation. 
_Amref Health Africa_ funded the project and expanded it to support a further 3,900 people.
